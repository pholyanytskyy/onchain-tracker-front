# abbie

abbie is an on-chain activity filter that helps projects select
users for airdrops. Set up the required on-chain activities, and
abbie will provide a list of users who complete all actions within
the specified period.

## Installation

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure enviranment variable `VITE_API_BASE`, for example:

```bash
export VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:3000
```

Run the application:

```bash
yarn
yarn build
yarn preview
```
